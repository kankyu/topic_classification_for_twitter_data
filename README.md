# Topic classification for Twitter Data

<!--Hypothesis:-->
<!--Is it viable to build a recommendation hashtag system with machine learning algorithms-->

Explore the performance of a hashtag recommendaton system with machine learning algorithms (specifically Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random forests).
Then deploying the best performing algorithm onto a web app, where the web app will allow the user to make twitter user timeline requests and perform a classification on the messages retrieved.

<!--Improvements that can be made-->
<!--Data engineering-->
